                <h3>About</h3>
                <pre>Worldview Mobile is a REST client for NASA\'s <a href=\"https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs\">Global Imagery Browse Services</a> (GIBS).
                GIBS is a public API providing access to satellite data and imagery from the EOS and A-Train satellites.
                While this application is not directly related to NASA\'s <a href=\"https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/\">Worldview</a>,
                I worked on improvements on the project in an internship in NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center and created this based on the idea a better interface could be made for mobile devices.
                </pre>
